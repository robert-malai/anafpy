# Workflow skills

Beyond individual tools, these multi-step flows ship as **workflow playbooks**,
delivered two ways from one source. Their home is the **`anafpy-workflows`
plugin** (`plugins/anafpy-workflows/skills/*/SKILL.md`): installed from the
`anafpy` marketplace (`/plugin marketplace add robert-malai/anafpy`) they surface
in **Cowork** (and chat) as Agent Skills, invoked in plain language or picked from
the sidebar. The MCP server **also** re-serves the same files as same-name MCP
**prompts**, so other prompt-capable clients get them too: Claude Desktop's "+"
menu, or `/mcp__anafpy__<name>` in Claude Code. An optional `source` argument
seeds the workflow with where the data lives.

There is one source of truth — the plugin's SKILL.md files — with two consumers.
A skill drives the anafpy tools, so a Cowork user needs both the plugin (the
playbooks — [setup walkthrough](setup.md) step 8) and the anafpy connector (the
tools — steps 2–4 of the same walkthrough).

## `etransport-declare`

Files an e-Transport declaration and obtains a UIT code from transport data found
in **any source** — an email, a PDF invoice, a CMR, a spreadsheet, or the
conversation itself. The playbook walks Claude through the full flow:

1. **Extract** the transport data from the source you point it at.
2. **Map** it onto the structured declaration (looking up ANAF codes via
   `etransport_nomenclature` where needed).
3. **Prepare** — `etransport_prepare_declaration` composes the XML and returns a
   preview plus a confirmation token.
4. **Show you the preview for approval.** Nothing has been filed yet.
5. **Submit** on your explicit approval — `etransport_submit` with the token.
6. **Poll** the status until ANAF issues a valid UIT, and report it.
7. **Render the driver's UIT card** (`etransport_uit_card` — a phone-shaped PDF
   with the code set large and a QR) by default, and offer the A4 detail
   document (`etransport_uit_details`) for the partner company or the user's
   records.

Before extracting anything, the playbook orients on the legal requirements
(OUG 41/2022 and the ANAF/AVR procedure): whether the transport must be declared
at all — exemptions included — whether the filing CIF is the party the law
obliges to declare, and the UIT timing windows. After filing, it relays the
obligations that attach to the issued UIT: handing it to the driver before
departure, GPS tracking for the whole route, and the declaration's immutability
once the vehicle moves. The compiled legal reference behind this guidance is
served to the model as the `anafref://etransport/legal` resource.

It also handles corrections of an already-issued UIT (`correction_of_uit`).

The same two-step gate described in [Tools](tools.md) applies throughout: the
skill can never skip the preview-and-approval step, because the submit tool
refuses to file without the single-use confirmation token plus `confirm=true`.

## `personal-income-summary`

Answers *"what was my income?"* for a Romanian natural person by pulling the
authoritative ANAF records from the **SPV mailbox** and presenting a clean
per-year summary — with an optional Excel workbook. It triggers on both formal
and casual phrasing, in Romanian or English (*"veniturile mele"*, *"cât am
câștigat anul trecut"*, "income summary", "adeverință de venit"). The playbook
walks Claude through:

1. **Confirm the SPV session** — `auth_status` then `spv_status` (which returns
   the certificate holder's CNP and authorized CUIs). This skill is read-only:
   it never files anything.
2. **Pick the CNP and years** — defaults to *personal* income (the CNP on the
   certificate) over the last three completed fiscal years; asks only if the
   account also holds company CIFs and the request is ambiguous.
3. **Request the reports** — `spv_cerere` for both `Adeverinte Venit` (the
   authoritative income certificate) and `D212` (the Declarația Unică duplicate,
   as a cross-check) per year.
4. **Wait and download** — `spv_asteapta_raport` saves each PDF to disk (retrying
   the occasional handshake timeout).
5. **Extract and summarize** — reads the figures from the certificates and gives
   a per-year table with totals and a trend line, keeping the official PDFs
   alongside.
6. **Offer an Excel workbook** (optional) — a formula-driven per-year summary
   plus one detail sheet per year, built via the **xlsx** skill.

Because it only uses the read-only `spv_*` tools, there is no filing gate — the
human gate here is the SPV login (certificate PIN / 2FA), described in the
[setup walkthrough](setup.md) step 6.

## `declaratie-prepare`

Builds, validates, renders, signs, files, and tracks a Romanian tax
declaration starting from **unstructured source data** — an accountant's
email, a spreadsheet, pasted numbers, or just "file my VAT return for March".
It drives the `declaratie_*` tools plus the public `anaf_*` lookups. The
playbook walks Claude through:

1. **Identify the form** — named by you it is simply echoed; otherwise inferred
   from the data against the form inventory, asking only when two forms remain
   plausible. `declaratie_duk_status` confirms DUKIntegrator is configured and
   flags a stale validator.
2. **Read the form's completion guide** (served as an `anafref://` resource) —
   who files and when, the row-by-row → XSD attribute map, validated example
   instances, and the known gotchas.
3. **Infer identity via lookup, not questions** — `anaf_lookup_taxpayers` fills
   the company name/address from the CUI and cross-checks eligibility (VAT
   registration, cash accounting, inactive flags); partner CUIs are validated
   the same way.
4. **Ask for the rest in one batch** — period, settlement type, amounts, and
   the form's must-ask fields; amounts are never guessed or extrapolated.
5. **Author the XML** from the guide's mapping, computing derived rows and the
   control sum per its formulas, and `nr_evid` with `declaratie_nr_evid`
   (form-aware), never by hand.
6. **Validate in a loop** — `declaratie_validate`; the findings are ANAF's own
   messages, so fix the XML and retry until `ok` (warning-only forms like D700
   pass with the notice relayed).
7. **Pre-filing reconciliation** — states what ANAF will cross-check this
   filing against (D300 ↔ D394 ↔ D390, e-Factura, SAF-T) so mismatches surface
   before filing, not as conformity notifications after.
8. **Render and review** — `declaratie_render` writes the official PDF for you
   to check.
9. **Sign on your explicit go** — `declaratie_sign` with `confirm=true`, after
   a warning that the certificate PIN/2FA prompt is about to fire.
10. **File on your explicit go** — `declaratie_portal_status` probes the
    portal session (no 2FA); if it lapsed, `declaratie_portal_login` with your
    approval (your certificate prompt fires); then `declaratie_prepare` →
    filing recap → `declaratie_submit` with `confirm=true`. Where the portal
    tools are opted out (`ANAFPY_DECLARATII_UPLOAD`), you file the signed PDF
    at anaf.ro → Depunere declarații yourself and note the upload index.
11. **Confirm** — `declaratie_status` checks acceptance by upload index (no
    login needed) and `declaratie_recipisa` saves the signed filing receipt —
    available only ~60 days, so it's archived promptly.

The human gates are the batched questions, the PDF review, the signature
approval, the portal login (both fire your certificate PIN / 2FA), and the
filing approval; the skill never signs or files without your explicit
go-ahead relayed as `confirm=true`, and a signature approval never doubles as
the filing approval.
