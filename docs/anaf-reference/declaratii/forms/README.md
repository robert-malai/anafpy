# e-guvernare declaration inventory

Every form ANAF's DUKIntegrator update feed lists has a validator jar and is
therefore filable electronically (portal upload / e-guvernare). This page is the
full inventory — **173 forms** on 2026-07-17 — bucketed by how often a **typical
SME** (VAT-registered SRL with employees) files them. The buckets drive our
hands-on coverage: the top two buckets each get a per-form **completion guide**
in this folder — purpose & legal basis, who-files-&-when, a row-by-row
filling map onto the XSD attributes anafpy authors, DUK-validated example
instances, and researched filing gotchas, followed by the technical XSD/DUK
layer — produced per [METHOD.md](METHOD.md). The third bucket is inventory-only.

Conventions:

- **Validator (J/P)** is the feed's current `versiuneJ`/`versiuneP` — the
  *validator/PDF jar* versions, not the form's XSD version (D300's XSD is at
  `v12` while its jar is `J12.0.1`; the two usually track but are distinct).
- Per-form soft pages live at
  `https://static.anaf.ro/static/10/Anaf/Declaratii_R/<number>.html`
  (e.g. `300.html`); each version row there links the soft PDF, the validator
  zip, the structure PDF, and the XSD. **Newer XSDs are published with a `.xml`
  extension** (e.g. `d300_v12_11022026.xml`); older ones use `.xsd`.
  Known off-pattern pages: **D212** is `declaratie_unica.html` (`212.html`
  404s); **D700** links no standalone XSD — it ships inside the soft zip;
  **D406** (SAF-T) has its own page with `Ro_SAFT_Schema_*.xsd`.
- Validator jars install by dropping the feed's `JURL`/`PURL` jars into the DUK
  `dist/lib/` folder (CLI mode does not auto-update — see the
  [DUK reference](../duk.md) §1).
- The per-form files are produced and kept current by the documented
  procedure in [METHOD.md](METHOD.md) — structure, source tiers, research
  sweep, and verification gates for generating or updating a `dXXX.md`.

## Rarely (inventory only)

Niche regimes, one-off events, historic (pre-D212) individual forms, and
device/institutional reporting. Purposes below are from ANAF's catalog page or
well-established form knowledge; **"—" means the purpose was not verified from
the retrieved sources** (the catalog lists many forms only as "Declarație
electronică") — verify on the form's own page before relying on it.
