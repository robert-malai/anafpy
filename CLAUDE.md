Guidance for working in this repository. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the full
design rationale and [docs/anaf-reference/](docs/anaf-reference/) for a compiled local
reference of ANAF's APIs.

## What this is

`anafpy` — typed Python clients for Romania's **ANAF** tax-authority web services,
**e-Factura** (electronic invoicing), **e-Transport** (goods transport), and the
**public no-auth services** (`anafpy.public`: registry lookups + financial
statements). It is a
**thin, stateless transport client, not invoicing software**. **e-Factura outbound is
XML pass-through** (no invoice composition): callers bring complete invoice XML their
own system produced, and anafpy validates, files, tracks, and downloads; received UBL
is wrapped in a friendly **flat read view** (`FlatInvoice`, UBL→flat only) backing
the e-Factura inbox. **e-Transport is fully
translated** (decided 2026-07-03): there is usually no upstream software producing
declaration XML and ANAF's XSD is small and fully enumerated, so the e-Transport flat
models are **bidirectional** — the same models author a filing
(`build_etransport`/`render_etransport`, `upload_document`) and view a parsed one
(`read_flat_transport`), covering all four operations (declaration/correction,
deletion, confirmation, vehicle change). Phase 1 is the typed async clients; phase 2 is
the **MCP server** (`anafpy.mcp`, extra `anafpy[mcp]`) exposing the operations as
Claude Cowork skills. The client methods map 1:1 onto MCP tools — discrete operations,
serializable typed inputs/outputs, good docstrings. Distribution is **free and
as-is**: the library is for anyone to use; the MCP server is **best-effort**, and
configuring it — including provisioning the OAuth application on ANAF's portal —
is the user's responsibility (DESIGN.md §11).

Python **3.12+** (test 3.12 and 3.13). Built on **httpx** and **Pydantic v2**.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync --all-extras                 # set up env with all dev dependency groups
uv run pytest -q                     # tests (respx-mocked, credential-free)
uv run pytest tests/test_auth.py     # one file
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy                          # strict
ANAFPY_LIVE=1 uv run pytest -m live  # opt-in live smoke: public services + authenticated TEST (needs .env + auth login)
```

Run the MCP server (host-side, where the `anafpy auth login` token store lives):

```bash
ANAFPY_CLIENT_ID=... ANAFPY_CLIENT_SECRET=... ANAFPY_CIF=... \
  uv run python -m anafpy.mcp        # stdio; or the `anafpy-mcp` console script
```

Config is env-only — `anafpy.mcp.config.ServerConfig` is a `pydantic-settings`
`BaseSettings` (use `ServerConfig.from_env()` for a friendly `AnafConfigError`):
`ANAFPY_CLIENT_ID`,
`ANAFPY_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional — without them the server still starts and serves
the public `anaf_*` lookups; the authenticated tools raise a how-to-enable
`AnafConfigError`), `ANAFPY_TOKEN_STORE` (default `~/.anafpy/tokens.json`),
`ANAFPY_ENV` (`test`/`prod`), `ANAFPY_CIF` (default fiscal code), `ANAFPY_DOCS_DIR`
(reference resources, defaults to the repo `docs/anaf-reference/`),
`ANAFPY_SKILLS_DIR` (workflow skills re-served as MCP prompts, defaults to the repo
`skills/`).

Codegen (only when re-vendoring XSDs — see below):

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_ubl.py
uv run python scripts/generate_etransport.py
```

All three gates (pytest / ruff / mypy --strict) are currently green and must stay green.

```

## Architecture & conventions

- **Both OAuth services share one host** `api.anaf.ro`, differing only by path prefix
  (`FCTEL/rest` vs `ETRANSPORT/ws/v1`) and `test`/`prod` segment. All of that lives in
  [_transport/base.py](src/anafpy/_transport/base.py); clients take an `environment`.
- **`PublicClient` is the odd one out**: the unauthenticated registries/bilanț live on
  `PUBLIC_HOST` (`webservicesp.anaf.ro`) — no `TokenProvider`, no `environment`
  (production only). Unlike the OAuth clients' no-auto-backoff stance, it **paces its
  own requests** (`min_request_interval`, default 1 req/s) because ANAF states that
  limit as a usage *rule*, not via 429s. Registry membership is read from the
  `registered` booleans, never from presence in `found` (RegAgric/RegCult return
  unknown CUIs in `found` with empty fields). The e-Factura register's HTTP 404 with a
  `found`/`notFound` body is a business "not found" (returned), not raised.
- **Auth is a separate layer.** Clients receive a `TokenProvider` and drive httpx via
  the `AnafAuth` (`httpx.Auth`) class, which handles transparent token refresh. The
  qualified-certificate step happens only in the interactive `anafpy auth login` browser
  flow; code-exchange and refresh are headless. Don't add cert/mTLS handling to clients.
  ANAF's portal only registers `https://` callback URLs (an `http://` one 400s —
  verified 2026-07-02); the login captures the code via `--paste` (no listener, the
  baseline), a TLS listener (`--tls-cert/--tls-key`), or plain HTTP behind an external
  TLS terminator — the listener binds *before* the browser opens (a fast redirect must
  not outrun it) and the CLI falls back to paste if it can't start or times out.
- **Clients are async**, own their `httpx.AsyncClient` (unless one is injected), and are
  async context managers (`async with EFacturaClient(...) as c:`).
- **Discrete methods do NO transport retry** — one call, one result-or-raise — so the
  non-idempotent `upload` POST is never silently repeated. Consumers bring their own
  retry. `tenacity` is used in exactly one place: the `upload_and_wait` poll loop, which
  retries on the *business* processing state, not on transport errors.
- **Module style**: `from __future__ import annotations`, explicit `__all__`, module +
  class docstrings, Google-style docstring sections. Line length 88. Keep new code in the
  voice of the surrounding files.
- **English identifiers everywhere in hand-written code**: variables, parameters, and
  model field names are descriptive English; ANAF's Romanian wire names survive only
  as Pydantic validation aliases (`data_creare` -> `created_at`), string literals
  (dict keys, query params, URL segments), and the generated schema models. Domain
  acronyms with no sensible translation (`cui`, `cif`, `uit`, `caen`) and enum
  members named after ANAF's own codes stay as-is.

## MCP server (`anafpy.mcp`)

- **Local stdio connector built on the phase-1 clients.** `create_server(config)`
  returns a `FastMCP`; `AppContext` owns one `TokenProvider` + lazily-built clients and
  closes them in the server lifespan. The server reads the existing token store and
  refreshes headlessly — it never drives the cert/browser step (that stays the CLI).
- **Workflow skills double as MCP prompts** (2026-07-03). Each `skills/*/SKILL.md`
  is re-served as a same-name prompt (`anafpy.mcp.skills` reads frontmatter + body;
  optional `source` argument seeds the workflow) so clients without the plugin
  (Claude Desktop, bare `claude mcp add`) get the playbooks user-invoked; only the
  plugin's copy is model-triggered. The SKILL.md files are the single source of
  truth — never duplicate their content into the server; parsing is
  `python-frontmatter`'s (the `mcp` extra), with `skills.py` only enforcing that
  `name`/`description` are present (missing fields fail loudly at server start).
- **No e-Factura filing tools** (removed 2026-07-03): outbound invoices come from
  third-party invoicing software, which files with ANAF directly — there is no MCP
  use case, so the e-Factura surface is **read-only** (inbox, download,
  `efactura_validate`); `efactura_get_status` went with the filing tools — an
  e-Factura upload id was only ever produced by them. `EFacturaClient.upload` /
  `get_status` stay for library users. If filing
  tools ever return, the pass-through rule still applies: the input must be the
  complete UBL XML the caller's software exported (`UblXmlInput` in
  `mcp/models.py`, now feeding only `efactura_validate`) — never composed, never
  the generated UBL schema models as tool input, no flat→UBL write mapping.
- **Binary artifacts go to disk (or a resource), never into context.** The model
  works from the flat `invoice` view; `efactura_download` optionally writes the
  signed archive ZIP (`save_zip_as`) and ANAF's `transformare` PDF rendering
  (`save_pdf_as`, best-effort — failures surface in `pdf_error`, never fail the
  download; rendered with `validate=False` since the message already passed ANAF
  validation at filing) to caller-given paths — the server is local stdio, so its
  filesystem is the user's (this is what enables batch flows like "save last
  month's invoices as `<date> - <partner>.pdf`", where the agent names the files).
  The PDF is also the resource template `anafmsg://{message_id}/pdf`
  (fetch+convert on read); there is deliberately **no ZIP resource** — a base64
  ZIP serves neither the model nor any host UI. Don't return base64 blobs from
  tools. (decided 2026-07-03; the
  pass-through rule is e-Factura-only). `etransport_prepare_declaration` /
  `_deletion` / `_confirmation` / `_vehicle_change` take the client-layer flat models
  or scalars, render the XML via `render_etransport`, and return it in
  `PreparedSubmission.xml` alongside the preview and token; the caller passes that
  XML back to `etransport_submit` verbatim (the token is bound to the rendered
  bytes, so any mangling fails closed). `etransport_prepare` (`EtransportXmlInput`)
  remains for callers with ready-made XML. `etransport_nomenclature` lists the XSD
  code lists (names accepted anywhere an enum-coded field is) plus the code-only
  `unit_codes` — the UN/ECE Rec 20/21 list ANAF's Schematron enforces for goods
  lines, carried in [mcp/unitcodes.py](src/anafpy/mcp/unitcodes.py) — see
  [mcp/nomenclatures.py](src/anafpy/mcp/nomenclatures.py).
- **`FlatInvoice` is a read view; the e-Transport flat models are bidirectional.**
  All are defined at the **client layer**
  ([efactura/models.py](src/anafpy/efactura/models.py),
  [etransport/models.py](src/anafpy/etransport/models.py)). `FlatInvoice` is produced
  *from* UBL by `read_flat_invoice` (UBL→flat only), backs `DownloadedMessage.view`
  (`download` tier 3) and the e-Factura inbox, is lossy by
  design — raw bytes + full UBL stay authoritative — and carries `complete` /
  `dropped_fields` when it can't represent something. There is no flat→UBL path; do
  not add one. The e-Transport `FlatTransport` / `FlatDeletion` / `FlatConfirmation`
  / `FlatVehicleChange` (union `FlatSubmission`) are a **full translation** of the
  XSD: `read_flat_transport` views, `build_etransport` / `render_etransport` author
  (only the schema's unused `xs:any` hooks are not carried); enum-coded fields are
  typed with the generated XSD enums, accept name or code, and serialize as names.
- **Tool display names**: every tool has an English MCP `title` following
  `Service: operation` — services are `e-Factura`, `e-Transport`, `ANAF Info`
  (public no-auth lookups), plus bare `ANAF` for `auth_status`. Titles are
  UI-only (the model sees `name` + `description`); keep them single-language.
- **Branded service names in prose**: in strings, messages, and docs the services
  are written exactly `e-Factura` and `e-Transport` — even at the start of a
  sentence or title. This is the branding ANAF itself uses on its website
  (decided 2026-07-03). Exceptions: identifiers stay English-convention
  (`EFacturaClient`, `efactura_*`), ANAF wire facts stay verbatim (the
  `eTransport` XML root/namespace, endpoint names, URLs), and quotes of ANAF's
  own material in `docs/anaf-reference/` keep ANAF's spelling.
- **Read-first, two-step gated mutations.** Read-only tools (`*_list*`, `*_status`,
  `*_lookup`, `etransport_nomenclature`, `efactura_validate`,
  `auth_status`, and the no-auth
  `anaf_*` public lookups over `PublicClient` — registries + financial statements,
  usable even with no OAuth credentials configured) are annotated `readOnlyHint` and freely
  callable. `efactura_download` is also freely callable but carries honest
  annotations (`readOnlyHint=False`, idempotent, non-destructive) because it may
  write files at caller-given paths; the two-step gate is for ANAF filings only. Filing (e-Transport only) is split `etransport_prepare*` →
  `etransport_submit`: prepare
  parses (or composes) the XML for a preview and returns an HMAC **confirmation token**
  (`mcp/tokens.py`) bound to the exact XML bytes and the CIF;
  submit requires that token (same document, same CIF) **and** `confirm=True`,
  and each token is **single-use** (`TokenLedger`) so a non-idempotent upload is never
  repeated on one approval. Don't collapse this into a `dry_run` bool.
- **Validation is ANAF's, not local.** `efactura_validate` calls the server-side
  `validare` endpoint via `EFacturaClient.validate_remote` (authoritative by
  definition). `validare`/`transformare` are **public, no-auth, prod-only** (their
  TEST paths 404), so the client routes them to `webservicesp.anaf.ro/prod`
  regardless of `environment` — validation works on test configs too and files
  nothing; e-Transport has no standalone validator — ANAF validates on upload.
  There is deliberately **no local rule engine** (a Schematron/saxonche extra existed
  and was removed 2026-07-02); prepare never blocks on validation — the human review +
  ANAF's verdict are the gates. Don't reintroduce local validation. Distinct from
  that: the e-Transport flat models carry **field-level shape checks** — the XSD
  constraints tightened by the *unconditional* rules of ANAF's e-Transport
  Schematron (UIT check digits, gross ≥ net, `ALTELE` needs a note, ...; the list
  is in DESIGN.md §5) — which fail at model construction as data hygiene. The
  Schematron's operation-type *conditional* rules stay ANAF's and appear only as
  field descriptions.

## Error model (important)

Hybrid, per design — do not collapse it:

- **Exceptions** (`AnafError` → `AnafAuthError`, `AnafTransportError`/`AnafResponseError`,
  `AnafRateLimitError`, `AnafConfigError`) are for transport / auth / programming errors.
  HTTP 429 raises `AnafRateLimitError` exposing `retry_after`; the client does **not**
  auto-back-off.
- **Business outcomes** (e-Factura `nok`/`REJECTED`, upload rejections with BR-RO
  findings) are returned as **typed values** (e.g. `UploadResult.accepted is False`,
  `MessageStatus.state`), never raised.
- **Listing and `info`** (`list_messages` / `list_notifications` / e-Transport `info`) are
  where a 200-with-error-note is split: ANAF overloads the note (e-Factura: `eroare`;
  e-Transport: `Errors[].errorMessage`, `info` also a top-level `error` string) for both
  "no results" and real errors, so a no-results note yields an **empty iterator** (`info`:
  an empty `InfoList` with the note in `.error`) while a genuine error **raises
  `AnafResponseError`** (`status_code=200`). The classifier is
  `_transport.base.is_empty_result_message`.

## Generated code — do not hand-edit

`src/anafpy/efactura/ubl/` and `src/anafpy/etransport/schema/` are generated by the
`scripts/generate_*.py` scripts from vendored XSDs in `schemas/`. They are committed as
source but excluded from ruff, mypy, and pyright/Pylance (see `extend-exclude` /
`exclude` in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)). To change them, edit the script /
re-vendor the XSD and regenerate; never edit the output by hand. Note: `xsdata[cli]`
is pinned `<25` — the `xsdata-pydantic` plugin targets the 24.x line and newer core
emits invalid fields. The e-Transport script post-processes the output: nomenclature
enum members get descriptive names derived from the XSD's own `xs:documentation`
annotations (`CodJudetType.CLUJ`, `CodTaraType.ROMANIA`; operation types use ANAF's
sigla with the full label as a trailing comment: `CodTipOperatiuneType.TTN`, ...)
instead of `VALUE_<code>`.

Public UBL entry points: `from anafpy.efactura import Invoice, CreditNote`.

## ANAF response formats

Response schemas come from ANAF's official per-endpoint **swagger presentations**
(vendored 2026-07-02 under `docs/anaf-reference/_sources/{efactura,etransport}-swagger/`
and folded into `docs/anaf-reference/*/api.md`) — the API PDFs cover URLs/params only.
First live TEST confirmations 2026-07-02: the e-Factura paginated list's no-results
shape (200 + `eroare` note) and the e-Transport `lista` no-results shape
(`Errors[].errorMessage`, `ExecutionStatus: 1`) both matched the docs exactly. A full
e-Transport TEST **roundtrip** 2026-07-02 (upload → `stareMesaj` `in prelucrare`→`ok`
→ `lista` → `info`) confirmed the upload/status/lista-with-results shapes and surfaced
one doc gap: `info`'s no-results case rides a **top-level singular `error` string**
(not `Errors[]`) — now handled by `_InfoEnvelope` / `_parse_info`. A full **e-Factura
TEST roundtrip** the same day (upload → `stareMesaj` `in prelucrare`→`ok` →
`descarcare` ZIP → paginated list with results) confirmed the e-Factura
upload/status/download shapes, and established that **`validare` and `transformare`
are prod-only** (the `test` paths answer HTTP 404) — since they are also public and
no-auth, the client always calls them on `webservicesp.anaf.ro/prod`, whatever its
`environment`. The
`live`-marked `tests/test_oauth_live.py` re-confirms the authenticated TEST shapes on
demand (needs `.env` credentials + `anafpy auth login`). The **public services** have no swagger —
their reference (`docs/anaf-reference/public/api.md`) is compiled from ANAF's
instruction files and **was live-confirmed in production** (2026-07-02); the `live`
test marker re-confirms those shapes on demand. When touching parsing code, treat the
doc as the source of truth and prefer being explicit over silently returning empty
results.

## Conventions for changes

- Keep `pytest`, `ruff`, and `mypy --strict` green; add/extend respx tests for client
  behavior changes (upload→poll→download, `nok` path, 401-refresh, 429 surfacing).
  The respx suite is the gate; the `live`-marked smoke tests
  ([tests/test_public_live.py](tests/test_public_live.py) — public services;
  [tests/test_oauth_live.py](tests/test_oauth_live.py) — authenticated TEST, read-only,
  credentials from the gitignored repo-root `.env` loaded by `tests/conftest.py`) exist
  only to re-confirm wire shapes on demand (`ANAFPY_LIVE=1`) and are skipped by
  default — don't move behavioural assertions there, and keep them read-only. The **two
  deliberate exceptions** are the roundtrip files —
  [tests/test_etransport_roundtrip_live.py](tests/test_etransport_roundtrip_live.py)
  **files** a domestic declaration composed via the flat authoring models — also
  keeping anafpy's own rendered XML honest — (upload → `stareMesaj` → `lista` →
  `info`) and
  [tests/test_efactura_roundtrip_live.py](tests/test_efactura_roundtrip_live.py)
  **files** a minimal CIUS-RO invoice (upload → `stareMesaj` → `descarcare` → list) —
  **TEST only, never prod** — to keep the filing wire shapes honest; don't add uploads
  to any other live file.
- **Keep the docs in sync with the change.** When a change alters the public surface,
  status, layout, or conventions, update the affected docs in the same change:
  [README.md](README.md) (what works / usage / install), this `CLAUDE.md` (layout,
  commands, conventions), [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) (design decisions), and
  `docs/anaf-reference/` (only when ANAF API facts change — keep its provenance
  frontmatter intact). Don't let docs drift behind the code.
- Don't commit, push, or create branches/PRs unless asked.
- The remote is `github.com/robert-malai/anafpy`. There is no CI workflow yet
  (planned, not done).
